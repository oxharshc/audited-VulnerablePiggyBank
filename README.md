# Basic Security Audit Summary

## Original Contract Problems

1. **Anyone can withdraw all money** - The biggest problem
2. **Missing semicolon** - Won't compile
3. **Empty attack() function** - Suspicious

## Fixed Version

The [`audited-VulnerablePiggyBank.sol`](audited-VulnerablePiggyBank.sol) fixes these issues:

1. **Only owner can withdraw** - Added `onlyOwner` modifier
2. **Fixed syntax** - Added missing semicolon
3. **Removed attack()** - Removed unnecessary function
4. **Better transfer method** - Used `call` instead of `transfer`

## Key Changes

```solidity
// OLD - BROKEN
function withdraw() public { 
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance); 
}

// NEW - SECURE
function withdraw() public onlyOwner {
    (bool success, ) = payable(owner).call{value: address(this).balance}("");
    require(success, "Transfer failed");
}
```

## Result

- ❌ Old contract: Anyone can steal all funds
- ✅ New contract: Only owner can withdraw funds
